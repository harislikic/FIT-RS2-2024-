## RabbitMQ Implementation

### AutoTrade Email Subscriber

#### ðŸ“© Description
AutoTrade Email Subscriber is a backend service that uses **RabbitMQ** to asynchronously send emails to users after a car reservation is approved. This service listens for messages from RabbitMQ, processes them, and sends appropriate emails to users via the **ReservationApprovalEmail** service.

### RabbitMQ Credentials
- **Username:** `guest`
- **Password:** `guest`

### Testing Email Notifications via RabbitMQ
To test sending email notifications via RabbitMQ:

1. **Create a profile** with your email address.
2. **Search for a car** in the system, e.g., `'Audi A3 2018'`.
3. **Make a reservation** for the selected car.
4. **Log in** to the admin account on mobile app:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `password123`
5. **Go to the "My Profile" section**, find your reservation, and approve it.
6. After approval, you should receive a **confirmation email** for the reservation you made.

---

## Additional Notes
- Ensure RabbitMQ is running before testing email notifications.
- Use **Docker** for setting up the backend services.
- **Stripe test cards** can be used for payment testing without actual transactions.
